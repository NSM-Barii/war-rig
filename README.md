> ⚠️ Currently in active development and testing. Features are being built and pushed regularly.

Portable wardriving rig built inside a hardened case. Raspberry Pi 5 running Kali Linux headless, multiple WiFi adapters, boots headless and runs fully automated.

---

## What It Does

| | |
|---|---|
| 📡 **AP on boot** | Pi creates its own WiFi hotspot (SSID: `Dooku`). Connect your phone, open `10.10.10.1:5000` |
| 📊 **Live dashboard** | FLOCK tab shows real-time WiFi and BLE detections. KISMET tab opens Kismet's native wardriving UI |
| 🔍 **flock-back** | Full WiFi and BLE wardriving powered by [flock-back](https://github.com/nsm-barii/flock-back) |
| 🌐 **Kismet** | RF wardriving across all monitor-mode adapters, accessible at `10.10.10.1:2501` |
| 📶 **Multi-adapter** | All non-AP adapters scanning simultaneously across 2.4GHz and 5GHz |
| ⚙️ **Auto-start** | Plug in and everything comes up on its own via systemd |
| 🔒 **SSH MODE** | Tap button on dashboard to drop AP and hand `wlan0` back for SSH access |
